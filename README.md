# Reinforcement learning in Trading
Reinforcement learning in trading and algorithmic trading is a fairly frequent example of the application of RL in practice.
As data, the agent is trained to trade shares of Yandex (YNDX) from 03.01.2018 to 06/19/2021, where the stock prices ranging from the end of 2019 to the present time are a test data set. Deep Network (DDN), although widely tested on video games or, for example, when solving server cooling [https://tproger.ru/news/google-deepmind-cooling /], it is only relatively recently that active research in the field of trade has begun. Many works have already achieved success. The Dual Double DQN algorithm was also implemented (Wang, et al. 2015) for an even better approximation, and in general, this algorithm shows itself in a good way: it improves the quality of training and overall performance of the entire system.
